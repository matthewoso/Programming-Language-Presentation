		The original BASIC language was released on May 1, 1964 by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz and implemented under their direction by a team of Dartmouth College students. It was designed to allow students to write mainframe computer programs for the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, and was intended specifically for less technical users who did not have or want the mathematical background previously expected.
		
		<br>Almost universally, home computers of the 1980s had a ROM-resident BASIC interpreter, which the machines booted directly into.When the Apple II, PET 2001, and TRS-80 were all released in 1977, all three had BASIC as their primary programming language and operating environment. Upon boot, a BASIC interpreter in immediate mode was presented, not the command line interface used on systems running CP/M or MS-DOS. Commodore Business Machines included a version of Microsoft BASIC. The Apple II and TRS-80 each had two versions of BASIC, a smaller introductory version introduced with the initial releases of the machines and a more advanced version developed as interest in the platforms increased.

		<p><b>Data manipulation</b>
<br>LET: assigns a value (which may be the result of an expression) to a variable.
<br>DATA: holds a list of values which are assigned sequentially using the READ command.
Program flow control
<br>IF ... THEN ... ELSE: used to perform comparisons or make decisions.
<br>FOR ... TO ... {STEP} ... NEXT: repeat a section of code a given number of times. A variable that acts as a counter is available within the loop.
<br>WHILE ... WEND and REPEAT ... UNTIL: repeat a section of code while the specified condition is true. The condition may be evaluated before each iteration of the loop, or after.
<br>DO ... LOOP {WHILE} or {UNTIL}: repeat a section of code Forever or While/Until the specified condition is true. The condition may be evaluated before each iteration of the loop, or after.
<br>GOTO: jumps to a numbered or labelled line in the program.
<br>GOSUB: jumps to a numbered or labelled line, executes the code it finds there until it reaches a RETURN Command, on which it jumps back to the operator following the GOSUB â€“ either after a colon, or on the next line. This is used to implement subroutines.
<br>ON ... GOTO/GOSUB: chooses where to jump based on the specified conditions. See Switch statement for other forms.
<br>DEF FN: a pair of keywords introduced in the early 1960s to define functions. The original BASIC functions were modelled on FORTRAN single-line functions. BASIC functions were one expression with variable arguments, rather than subroutines, with a syntax on the model of DEF FND(x) = x*x at the beginning of a program. Function names were originally restricted to FN+one letter.
<br><b>Input and output</b>
<br>LIST: displays all inputted code.
<br>PRINT: displays a message on the screen or other output device.
<br>INPUT: asks the user to enter the value of a variable. The statement may include a prompt message.
<br>TAB or AT: sets the position where the next character will be shown on the screen or printed on paper.</p>
